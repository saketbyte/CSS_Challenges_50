				<h1>The Gentle Art of Empathy</h1>
				<small>Samriddh Singh</small>
				<p>
					Empathy, the delicate bridge between hearts, allows us to transcend our own experiences and step into the shoes of another, feeling the pulse of their joys and sorrows as if they were our own. It is the poetry of human connection, where boundaries blur and we are reminded of the
					shared humanity that binds us all. Alan Watts beautifully observed, “You and I are all as much continuous with the physical universe as a wave is continuous with the ocean.” In this continuity, empathy becomes the language of unity, dissolving isolation and fostering compassion.

				<p>
					Carl Sagan’s words echo this sentiment, “For small creatures such as we, the vastness is bearable only through love.” Empathy is that love in action—a radical act of kindness that fuels understanding in a fragmented world. In La Peste, Albert Camus encapsulates its necessity: “There
					is more to admire in men than to despise.” When we embody empathy, we choose admiration over division, light over shadow, and build a world where every soul feels seen, heard, and valued.
